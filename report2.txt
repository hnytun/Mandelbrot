If i could just find out how to vectorize the numpy array to store the tuples of rgb and then add the mandelbrot to all
the coordinates at the same time with numpy, instead of the double nested loop, the mandelbrot_2.py would have been significantly faster,
since numpy isnt using the python interpreter to run, which my double nested loop is.
but since this did not work out, i have no way to prove with a timer that this infact is the case. I have tried to implement the numpy
tuple list in my code, but it is commented out because it didnt want to take in tuples as elements in the 2d array when i tried to make the
array with numpy. Actually, my mandelbrot_2 is slower than mandelbrot_1, which is ironic.
